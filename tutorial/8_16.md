# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use GroupBy Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **groupBy** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **groupBy** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **groupBy** method takes a predicate function as its parameter and uses it to group elements by key and values into a **Map** collection.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **groupBy** method is as follows:

```scala
groupBy[K](f: (A) â‡’ K): immutable.Map[K, Repr]

```

 

The **groupBy **method is a member of the [TraversableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a sequence of donut elements where each element in the sequence is of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to group elements in a sequence using the groupBy function

The code below shows how to use the **groupBy** method to group elements in the donut sequence by the first character for each donut.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to group elements in a sequence using the groupBy function")
val donutsGroup: Map[Char, Seq[String]] = donuts.groupBy(_.charAt(0))
println(s"Group elements in the donut sequence by the first letter of the donut name = $donutsGroup")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to group elements in a sequence using the groupBy function
Group elements in the donut sequence by the first letter of the donut name = Map(S -> List(Strawberry Donut), G -> List(Glazed Donut), P -> List(Plain Donut))

```

**NOTE:**

- We end up with a [Map](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/scala-tutorial-learn-use-immutable-map/) where the letter S points to Strawberry Donut, letter G points to Glazed Donut and P points to Plain Donut.

### 3. How to create a case class to represent Donut objects

The code below shows how to use a [Case Class](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-define-use-case-class/) to represent donut objects.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to create a case class to represent Donut objects")
case class Donut(name: String, price: Double)


```

### 4. How to create a Sequence of type Donut

The code below shows how to use the Donut **case class** from Step 3 and create a sequence of donut elements of type Donut.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to create a Sequence of type Donut")
val donuts2: Seq[Donut] = Seq(Donut("Plain Donut", 1.5), Donut("Strawberry Donut", 2.0), Donut("Glazed Donut", 2.5))
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to create a Sequence of type Donut
Elements of donuts2 = List(Donut(Plain Donut,1.5), Donut(Strawberry Donut,2.0), Donut(Glazed Donut,2.5))

```

 

### 5. How to group case classes donut objects by the name property

The code below shows how to group the donut objects represented by case class Donut from Step 3 by their name property using the **groupBy** method.

```scala
println(s"\nStep 5: How to group case classes donut objects by the name property")
val donutsGroup2: Map[String, Seq[Donut]] = donuts2.groupBy(_.name)
println(s"Group element in the sequence of type Donut grouped by the donut name = $donutsGroup2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 5: How to group case classes donut objects by the name property
Group element in the sequence of type Donut grouped by the donut name = Map(Glazed Donut -> List(Donut(Glazed Donut,2.5)), Plain Donut -> List(Donut(Plain Donut,1.5)), Strawberry Donut -> List(Donut(Strawberry Donut,2.0)))

```
