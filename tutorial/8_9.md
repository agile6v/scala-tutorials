# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Find Function


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **find** function on collection data structures in Scala. The **find** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **find** method takes a predicate function as parameter and uses it to find the first element in the collection which matches the predicate. It returns an **Option** and as such it may return a **None** for the case where it does not match any elements in the collection with the predicate function.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **find** method is as follows:

```scala
def find(p: (A) â‡’ Boolean): Option[A]

```

 

The **find** method is a member of the [TraversableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of Donut elements of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to find a particular element in the sequence using the find function

The code below shows how to use the **find** method to find a particular element in the sequence - more precisely to find for a Plain Donut element in the donut sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to find a particular element in the sequence using the find function")
val plainDonut: Option[String] = donuts.find(donutName => donutName == "Plain Donut")
println(s"Find Plain Donut = ${plainDonut.get}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to find a particular element in the sequence using the find function
Find Plain Donut = Plain Donut

```

**NOTE:**

- The **find** method returns an [Option](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-function-return-type/) type and as such it returned an Option of type String in the above example.

### 3. How to find element Vanilla Donut which does not exist in the sequence using the find function

The code below shows how to use the **find** method to find a Vanilla Donut element in the donut sequence. Note however that there is no Vanilla Donut element in the donut sequence which we created in Step 1.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to find element Vanilla Donut which does not exist in the sequence using the find function")
val vanillaDonut: String = donuts.find(_ == "Vanilla Donut").get
println(s"Find Vanilla Donuts = $vanillaDonut")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to find element Vanilla Donut which does not exist in the sequence using the find function
Exception in thread "main" java.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get


```

**NOTE:**

- Since the **find** method returns an [Option](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-option-avoid-null/), you should be careful with simply calling .get otherwise you may get the **java.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get** exception

### 4. How to find element Vanilla Donut using the find function and getOrElse

The code below shows how to use the **find** method which returns an Option type and make use of the **getOrElse** method to avoid getting **java.util.NoSuchElementException: None.get** exception for the cases when the **find** method does not match any elements.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to find element Vanilla Donut using the find function and getOrElse")
val vanillaDonut2: String = donuts.find(_ == "Vanilla Donut").getOrElse("Vanilla Donut was not found!")
println(s"Find Vanilla Donuts = $vanillaDonut2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to find element Vanilla Donut using the find function and getOrElse
Find Vanilla Donuts = Vanilla Donut was not found!

```
