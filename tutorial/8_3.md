# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Collect Function


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **collect** function on collection data structures in Scala. The **collect** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **collect** method takes a [Partial Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-partial-function-trait/) as its parameter and applies it to all the elements in the collection to create a new collection which satisfies the Partial Function.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **collect** method is as follows:

```scala
def collect[B](pf: PartialFunction[A, B]): Traversable[B]

```

 

The **collect** method is a member of the [TraversableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence which contains donut names and prices

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence which will contain String elements for donut names and Double elements for the donut prices.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence which contains donut names and prices")
val donutNamesandPrices: Seq[Any] = Seq("Plain Donut", 1.5, "Strawberry Donut", 2.0, "Glazed Donut", 2.5)
println(s"Elements of donutNamesAndPrices = $donutNamesandPrices")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence which contains donut names and prices
Elements of donutNamesAndPrices = List(Plain Donut, 1.5, Strawberry Donut, 2.0, Glazed Donut, 2.5)

```

 

### 2. How to use collect function to cherry pick all the donut names

The code below shows how to use the **collect** function to cherry pick only the donut names which are of String types.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to use collect function to cherry pick all the donut names")
val donutNames: Seq[String] = donutNamesandPrices.collect{ case name: String => name }
println(s"Elements of donutNames = $donutNames")


```

**NOTE:**

- We are making use of a [Partial Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-partial-function-trait/) to filter elements of type String.

### 3. How to use collect function to cherry pick all the donut prices

The code below shows how to use the **collect** function to cherry pick only donut prices which are of Double types.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to use collect function to cherry pick all the donut prices")
val donutPrices: Seq[Double] = donutNamesandPrices.collect{ case price: Double => price }
println(s"Elements of donutPrices = $donutPrices")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to use collect function to cherry pick all donut prices
Elements of donutPrices = List(1.5, 2.0, 2.5)

```
