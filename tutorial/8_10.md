# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use FlatMap Function


## Overview

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **flatMap** function on collection data structures in Scala. The **flatMap** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **flatMap** method takes a predicate function, applies it to every element in the collection. It then returns a new collection by using the elements returned by the predicate function. The **flatMap** method is essentially a combination of the **map** method being run first followed by the **flatten** method.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **flatMap** method is as follows:

```scala
def flatMap[B](f: (A) â‡’ GenTraversableOnce[B]): TraversableOnce[B]

```

 

The **flatMap **method is a member of the [TraversableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableLike.html) trait but there are specialized versions of the **flatMap** methods for given collection types.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of Donut elements of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts1: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts1 = $donuts1")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts1 = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to initialize another Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize another Sequence of Donut elements of type String .

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to initialize another Sequence of donuts")
val donuts2: Seq[String] = Seq("Vanilla Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to initialize another Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts2 = List(Vanilla Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 3. How to create a List of donuts initialized using the two Sequences from Step 1 and Step 2

The code below shows how to create a List of donut elements and initialize the List by using the two donut sequences from Step 1 and Step 2 respectively.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to create a List of donuts initialized using the two Sequences from Step 1 and Step 2")
val listDonuts: List[Seq[String]] = List(donuts1, donuts2)
println(s"Elements of listDonuts = $listDonuts")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to create a List of donuts initialized using the two Sequences from Step 1 and Step 2
Elements of listDonuts = List(List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut), List(Vanilla Donut, Glazed Donut))


```

**NOTE:**

- We end up with a List containing two inner lists: **List(List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut), List(Vanilla Donut, Glazed Donut))**
- What if you need to produce a **single** List of donut elements as opposed to having a List with two inner lists? We can achieve this using the **flatMap** method as shown in Step 4 below.

### 4. How to return a single list of donut using the flatMap function

The code below shows how to use the **flatMap** method on the List of donuts which contains two inner donut lists and return a single donut List of type String.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to return a single list of donut using the flatMap function")
val listDonutsFromFlatMap: List[String] = listDonuts.flatMap(seq => seq)
println(s"Elements of listDonutsFromFlatMap as a flatMap as a single list = $listDonutsFromFlatMap")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to return a single list of donut using the flatMap function
Elements of listDonutsFromFlatMap as a flatMap as a single list = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut, Vanilla Donut, Glazed Donut)

```
