# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use IsEmpty Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **isEmpty** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **isEmpty** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **isEmpty** method will check whether a given collection is empty and will return either true or false.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **isEmpty** method is as follows:

```scala
abstract def isEmpty: Boolean

```

 

The **isEmpty **method is a member of the [TraversableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableLike.html) trait, but there are other concrete implementations for corresponding collection types.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a sequence of donut elements where each element in the sequence is of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to find out if a sequence is empty using isEmpty function

The code below shows how to find out if a Sequence is empty by using the isEmpty method.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to find out if a sequence is empty using isEmpty function")
println(s"Is donuts sequence empty = ${donuts.isEmpty}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to find out if a sequence is empty using isEmpty function
Is donuts sequence empty = false

```

 

### 3. How to create an empty sequence

The code below shows how to create an empty Sequence of type String to represent an empty donut Sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to create an empty sequence")
val donuts2: Seq[String] = Seq.empty[String]
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to create an empty sequence
Elements of donuts2 = List()

```

 

### 4. How to find out if a sequence is empty using isEmpty function

The code below shows how to find out if the Sequence from Step 3 above is empty by using the isEmpty method.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to find out if a sequence is empty using isEmpty function")
println(s"Is donuts2 sequence empty = ${donuts2.isEmpty}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to find out if a sequence is empty using isEmpty function
Is donuts2 sequence empty = true

```
