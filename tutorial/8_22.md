# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Max Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **max** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **max** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/)collection data structures.

 

The **max **method will iterate through all the elements in a collection and return the largest element.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **max** method is as follows:

```scala
def max: A

```

 

The **max** method is a member of the [TraversableOnce](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableOnce.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of donut elements where each element in the Sequence is of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to find the maximum element in the sequence using the max function

The code below shows how to use the **max **method to find the largest donut of type String element in the donut sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to find the maximum element in the sequence using the max function")
println(s"Max element in the donuts sequence = ${donuts.max}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to find the maximum element in the sequence using the max function
Max element in the donuts sequence = Strawberry Donut

```

**NOTE:**

- Since the donut elements are of type String, the **max** method is using the **natural order** of String.

### 3. How to initialize donut prices

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of type Double to represent donut prices.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to initialize donut prices")
val prices: Seq[Double] = Seq(1.50, 2.0, 2.50)
println(s"Elements of prices = $prices")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to initialize donut prices
Elements of prices = List(1.5, 2.0, 2.5)

```

 

### 4. How to find the maximum element in the sequence using the max function

The code below shows how to use the **max** method to find the largest donut price in the Sequence representing donut prices.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to find the maximum element in the sequence using the max function")
println(s"Max element in the donut prices sequence = ${prices.max}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to find the maximum element in the sequence using the max function
Max element in the donut prices sequence = 2.5

```

**NOTE:**

- Since the donut prices elements are of type Double, the **max** method is using the **natural order** of type Double.
