# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use DropWhile Function


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **dropWhile** function on collection data structures in Scala. The **dropWhile** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/)collection data structures.

 

The **dropWhile** method takes a **predicate** function parameter that will be used to drop all the elements in a collection which satisfies the predicate function. It will then return a new collection with elements that matched the predicate function.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **dropWhile** method is as follows:

```scala
def dropWhile(p: (A) â‡’ Boolean): Repr

```

 

The **dropWhile** method is a member of the [IterableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/IterableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of Donut elements of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to drop elements from the sequence using the dropWhile function

The code below shows how to use the **dropWhile** method to drop elements from the Donut sequence whose donut names start with the letter P.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to drop elements from the sequence using the dropWhile function")
println(s"Drop donut elements whose name starts with letter P = ${donuts.dropWhile(_.charAt(0) == 'P')}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to drop elements from the sequence using the dropWhile function
Drop donut elements whose name starts with letter P = List(Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 3. How to declare a predicate function to be passed-through to the dropWhile function

The code below shows how to declare a **predicate** **function** which will be passed-through to the **dropWhile** method. The predicate function will have the same behaviour as Step 2 where it will return true for donut names which start with the letter P.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to declare a predicate function to be passed-through to the dropWhile function")
val dropElementsPredicate: (String) => Boolean = (donutName) => donutName.charAt(0) == 'P'
println(s"Value function dropElementsPredicate = $dropElementsPredicate")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to declare a predicate function to be passed-through to the dropWhile function
Value function dropElementsPredicate = <function1>

```

**NOTE:**

- The predicate function is a [Value Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/).

### 4. How to drop elements using the predicate function from Step 3

The code below shows how to call the **dropWhile** method by passing through the value predicate function from Step 3 in order to drop elements whose donut names start with letter P.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to drop elements using the predicate function from Step 3")
println(s"Drop elements using function from Step 3 = ${donuts.dropWhile(dropElementsPredicate)}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to drop elements using the predicate function from Step 3
Drop elements using function from Step 3 = List(Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```
