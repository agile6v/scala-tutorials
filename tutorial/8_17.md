# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Head Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **head** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **head** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/)collection data structures.

 

The **head** method will return the first element in the collection.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **head** method is as follows:

```scala
def head: A

```

 

The **head **method is a member of the [IterableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/IterableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a sequence of donut elements where each element in the sequence is of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to access the first element of the donut sequence

The code below shows how to access the first element in the donut sequence by using the zero index.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to access the first element of the donut sequence")
println(s"First element of donut sequence = ${donuts(0)}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to access the first element of the donut sequence
First element of donut sequence = Plain Donut

```

 

### 3. How to access the first element of the donut sequence using the head method

The code below shows how to use the **head** method to access the first element of the donut sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to access the first element of the donut sequence using the head method")
println(s"First element of donut sequence using head method = ${donuts.head}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to access the first element of the donut sequence using the head method
First element of donut sequence using head method = Plain Donut

```

 

### 4. How to create an empty sequence

The code below shows how to represent an empty donut sequence by creating an empty sequence of type String.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to create an empty sequence")
val donuts2: Seq[String] = Seq.empty[String]
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to create an empty sequence
Elements of donuts2 = List()

```

 

### 5. How to access the first element of the donut sequence using the headOption function

The code below shows how to use the **headOption** method to access the first element of an empty sequence in order to avoid unnecessary runtime exceptions on empty sequences.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to access the first element of the donut sequence using the headOption function")
println(s"First element of empty sequence = ${donuts2.headOption.getOrElse("No donut was found!")}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 5: How to access the first element of the donut sequence using the headOption function
First element of empty sequence = No donut was found!

```

**NOTE:**

- We also made use of the **getOrElse()** method which you can review from the [tutorial on Option, Some and None](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-option-avoid-null/).

This concludes our tutorial on **Learn How To Use Head Function With Examples **and I hope you've found it useful!
