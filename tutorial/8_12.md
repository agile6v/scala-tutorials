# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Fold Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **fold** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **fold** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/)collection data structures.

 

The **fold** method takes an associative binary operator function as parameter and will use it to collapse elements from the collection. The **fold** method allows you to also specify an **initial** **value**.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **fold** method is as follows:

```scala
def fold[A1 >: A](z: A1)(op: (A1, A1) â‡’ A1): A1

```

 

The **fold** method is a member of the [TraversableOnce](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableOnce.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a sequence of donut prices

The code below shows how to initialize a sequence of donut prices where each element in the sequence is of type Double.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a sequence of donut prices")
val prices: Seq[Double] = Seq(1.5, 2.0, 2.5)
println(s"Donut prices = $prices")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a sequence of donut prices
Donut prices = List(1.5, 2.0, 2.5)

```

 

### 2. How to sum all the donut prices using fold function

The code below shows how to sum all the donut prices from the sequence by using the **fold**method.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to sum all the donut prices using fold function")
val sum = prices.fold(0.0)(_ + _)
println(s"Sum = $sum")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to sum all the donut prices using fold function
Sum = 6.0

```

**NOTE:**

- Note that we passed in a default or initial value of **0.0** to the **fold** method because the sequence of Donuts was of type **Double**.

### 3. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of donuts where each element is of type String.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain", "Strawberry", "Glazed")
println(s"Elements of donuts1 = $donuts")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts1 = List(Plain, Strawberry, Glazed)

```

 

### 4. How to create a String of all donuts using fold function

The code below shows how to create a String representation for all the donut elements in the Sequence and also append the word Donut to each element using the **fold** method.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to create a String of all donuts using fold function")
println(s"All donuts = ${donuts.fold("")((a, b) => a + b + " Donut ")}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to create a String of all donuts using fold function
All donuts = Plain Donut Strawberry Donut Glazed Donut 

```

 

### 5. How to declare a value function to create the donut string

The code below shows how to declare a [Value Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/) to encapsulate the behaviour for creating a String representation for all donut elements.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to declare a value function to create the donut string")
val concatDonuts: (String, String) => String = (a, b) => a + b + " Donut "
println(s"Value function concatDonuts = $concatDonuts")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 5: How to declare a value function to create the donut string
Value function concatDonuts = <function2>

```

 

### 6. How to create a String of all donuts using value function from Step 5 and fold function

The code below shows how to create a String representation for the donut elements by passing through the [Value Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/) from Step 5 to the **fold** method.

```scala
println("\nStep 6: How to create a String of all donuts using value function from Step 5 and fold function")
println(s"All donuts = ${donuts.fold("")(concatDonuts)}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 6: How to create a String of all donuts using value function from Step 5 and fold function
All donuts = Plain Donut Strawberry Donut Glazed Donut 

```
