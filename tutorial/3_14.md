# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Create Higher Order Function - Call-By-Name Function



在本节, we will learn how to create **Higher Order Function** which is a function that takes another function as its parameter.

 

This tutorial is a continuation of the [previous Higher Order Function tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-higher-order-function-parameter/) and we will showcase the difference between **call-by-name** and **call-by-value** function parameters.

## 步骤

### 1. How to define a List with Tuple3 elements

Let's start by defining a List containing Tuple3 elements which would represent the name of a donut, the quantity to be purchased and its price.

 

If you are unfamiliar with the Scala Tuple syntax, feel free to review the [tutorial on Tuples](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-tuples-pattern-match/).

```scala
println("Step 1: How to define a List with Tuple3 elements")
val listOrders = List(("Glazed Donut", 5, 2.50), ("Vanilla Donut", 10, 3.50))

```

 

### 2. How to define a function to loop through each Tuple3 elements of the List and calculate total cost

Assume that your donut store sells donuts worldwide and as such you need to convert the total cost of buying donuts to the local currency being used.

 

To this end, let's define a placeOrder() function which would take a list of donut orders as defined in Step 1. But the function also has an exchangeRate parameter to convert the total cost to the local currency.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to define a function to loop through each Tuple3 of the List and calculate total cost")
def placeOrder(orders: List[(String, Int, Double)])(exchangeRate: Double): Double = {
  var totalCost: Double = 0.0
  orders.foreach {order =>
    val costOfItem = order._2 * order._3 * exchangeRate
    println(s"Cost of ${order._2} ${order._1} = £$costOfItem")
    totalCost += costOfItem
  }
  totalCost
}

```

**NOTE:**

- We could have inlined the totalCost calculation and avoid the use of var, but we are showing each step of the calculation.
- We are also using parameter groups similar to what you've learned from the [tutorial on Curried Function With Parameter Groups](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-create-function-currying-parameter-groups/).

### 3. How to call function with curried group parameter for List of Tuple3 elements

The syntax for calling the placeOrder() function with currying parameters should be familiar to you already if you've followed the previous tutorials.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to call function with curried group parameter for List of Tuple3 elements")
println(s"Total cost of order = £${placeOrder(listOrders)(0.5)}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 3: How to call function with curried group parameter for List of Tuple3 elements
Cost of 5 Glazed Donut = £6.25
Cost of 10 Vanilla Donut = £17.5
Total cost of order = £23.75

```

**NOTE:**

- For simplicity, we're using 0.5 as the exchange rate.

### 4. How to define a call-by-name function

You should have already seen the syntax for call-by-name function as per the previous [tutorial on Higher Order Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-higher-order-function-parameter/).

 

As a result, let's redefine a placeOrder function which will accept a call-by-name parameter for the exchange rate.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to define a call-by-name function")
def placeOrderWithByNameParameter(orders: List[(String, Int, Double)])(exchangeRate: => Double): Double = {
  var totalCost: Double = 0.0
  orders.foreach {order =>
    val costOfItem = order._2 * order._3 * exchangeRate
    println(s"Cost of ${order._2} ${order._1} = £$costOfItem")
    totalCost += costOfItem
  }
  totalCost
}

```

**NOTE:**

- The **call-by-name** function parameter exchangeRate: => Double will **evaluate** any exchangeRate function **each time** it is called.
- This is in contrast to the function defined in Step 1 above which had a **call-by-value**function parameter for exchange rate. This meant that any exchange rate passed through would be **evaluated** **only** **once**.

### 5. How to define a simple USD to GBP function

With the call-by-name exchange rate parameter from Step 4 in mind, let's create a function which will randomly generate a USD to GBP currency conversion.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to define a simple USD to GBP function")
val randomExchangeRate = new Random(10)
def usdToGbp: Double = {
  val rate = randomExchangeRate.nextDouble()
  println(s"Fetching USD to GBP exchange rate = $rate")
  rate
}

```

### 6. How to call function with call-by-name parameter

We can then pass the USD to GBP function to the placeOrderWithByNameParameter() function as shown below.

 

```scala
println("\nStep 6: How to call function with call-by-name parameter")
println(s"Total cost of order = £${placeOrderWithByNameParameter(listOrders)(usdToGbp)}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 6: How to call function with call-by-name parameter
Fetching USD to GBP exchange rate = 0.7304302967434272
Cost of 5 Glazed Donut = £9.13037870929284
Fetching USD to GBP exchange rate = 0.2578027905957804
Cost of 10 Vanilla Donut = £9.023097670852312
Total cost of order = £18.15347638014515

```

**NOTE:**

- For each order in the list, a new exchange rate is being created and that's because the **call-by-name** function **usdToGbp** function is being **evaluated each time**.
