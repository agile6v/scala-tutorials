# Learn How To Use Tuples (Pattern Match)

在本节, we will show how to use the convenient **Tuple** classes to easily store elements as pairs. If you paid attention in your database class at school :) I'm pretty sure that you would have come across the word [Tuple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuple).

 

In Scala, you can think of tuples in terms of providing easy semantics for grouping your data points.

## 步骤

### 1. Using Tuple2 to store 2 data points

Let's continue using our donut examples from the [previous tutorials](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/). What if you would like to store the taste level of donuts along with the donut type? The **Tuple2** class is your friend here :)

```scala
println("Step 1: Using Tuple2 to store 2 data points")
val glazedDonutTuple = Tuple2("Glazed Donut", "Very Tasty")
println(s"Glazed Donut with 2 data points = $glazedDonutTuple")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 1: Using Tuple2 to store 2 data points
Glazed Donut with 2 data points = (Glazed Donut,Very Tasty)

```

### 2. Access each element in tuple

In Step 1, we've only printed the tuple **glazedDonutTuple**. What if you now would like to access **each** **individual** **element**.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: Access each element in tuple")
val donutType = glazedDonutTuple._1
val donutTasteLevel = glazedDonutTuple._2
println(s"$donutType taste level is $donutTasteLevel")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 2: Access each element in tuple
Glazed Donut taste level is Very Tasty

```

### 3. Using TupleN classes to store more than 2 data points

Let's extend our examples from Step 1 and 2. What if you also wanted to store the price of the glazed donut?. You now have **3 data points** namely the **donut** **type**, its **taste** **level** and then its **price**. Not to worry, Scala provides **Tuple3** class to achieve just this!

```scala
println("\nStep 3: Using TupleN classes to store more than 2 data points")
val glazedDonut = Tuple3("Glazed Donut", "Very Tasty", 2.50)
println(s"${glazedDonut._1} taste level is ${glazedDonut._2} and it's price is ${glazedDonut._3}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 3: Using TupleN classes to store more than 2 data points
Glazed Donut taste leve is Very Tasty and it's price is 2.5

```

### 4. How to use pattern matching on Tuples

In the [previous tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-pattern-matching/), we've shown how to use pattern matching in Scala. Let's create two additional donut tuples one for storing the data points of **Plain** **Donut** and another one for **Strawberry** **Donut**.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to use pattern matching on Tuples")
val strawberryDonut = Tuple3("Strawberry Donut", "Very Tasty", 2.50)
val plainDonut = Tuple3("Plain Donut", "Tasty", 2)

```

Now, let's store all our donuts tuples into a list as follows:

```scala
val donutList = List(glazedDonut, strawberryDonut, plainDonut)

```

Let's also assume that the **donutList** is returned to us by a call to some API which looked up the donut details from a database.

What if you would like to find the price of a Plain Donut in that list? To do this, we will loop through our **donutList** variable using the **foreach()** function.

```scala
val priceOfPlainDonut = donutList.foreach { tuple => {
  tuple match {
    case ("Plain Donut", taste, price) => println(s"Donut type = Plain Donut, price = $price")
    case d if d._1 == "Glazed Donut" => println(s"Donut type = ${d._1}, price = ${d._3}")
    case _ => None
    }
  }
}

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 4: How to use pattern matching on Tuples
Donut type = Glazed Donut, price = 2.5
Donut type = Plain Donut, price = 2

```

**NOTE:**

- We've used two flavors of case expressions similar to what we've learned from the previous [Pattern Matching tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-pattern-matching/).
- The first case expression `case ("Plain Donut", taste, price)` will match for **Plain** **Donut** and then store the **taste** and **price** data points into variables which you can then referenced.
- The second case expression `case d if d._1 == "Glazed Donut"` extracts a local variable named **d** and will only match on **Glazed** **Donut**.
- We've also provided a default case using the **wildcard underscore _** and simply return **None**.

### 5. Shortcut for creating Tuples

Using Tuples is so common that Scala has an elegant shortcut which we can use to create Tuples. You can simply enclose your data points within **()**

```scala
println("\nStep 5: Shortcut for creating Tuples")
val chocolateDonut = ("Chocolate Donut", "Very Tasty", 3.0)
println(s"Chocolate donut taste level = ${chocolateDonut._2}, price = ${chocolateDonut._3}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 5: Shortcut for creating Tuples
Chocolate donut taste level = Very Tasty, price = 3.0

```

This concludes our tutorial on** Learn How To Use Tuples (Pattern Match)** and I hope you've found it useful!


## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- How to create a Tuple with two data points using the Tuple2 class
- How to access each individual elements in a Tuple
- How to create and use Tuples with more than two data points
- How to use pattern matching on a list of tuples
- How to easily create Tuples using () brackets

## 提示

- You can write the pattern matching in Step 4 in a more elegant way as follows:

```scala
println("\nTip 1: A more elegant pattern matching within foreach function")
donutList.foreach {
  case ("Plain Donut", taste, price) => println(s"Donut type = Plain Donut, price = $price")
  case d if d._1 == "Glazed Donut" => println(s"Donut type = ${d._1}, price = ${d._3}")
  case _ => None
}

```

## 接下来是什么？

[下一节](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-option-avoid-null/), I will go over the use of **Option**, **Some** and **None** as a replacement for having to make use of **null** in your codebase.

Stay tuned!
