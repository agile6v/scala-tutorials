# Scala - How To Escape Characters And Create Multi-line String


在本节, we will show how to **escape characters** when writing text. In addition, we will learn how to **format multi-line text** so that it is more readable.

 

Make sure that you have followed the [tutorials from Chapter 1](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-1-getting-familiar-intellij-ide/) on how to install and use IntelliJ IDEA. Don't forget to also review the[ tutorials from Chapter 2](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/) as we will build on what we've previously learned.

## 步骤

###  1. How to escape a Json String

In tutorial [How To Declare Variables And Types](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-basic-tutorial-declare-variables-types/), we learned the syntax to create and assign an **immutable** String variable. Let's assume that you have a JSON String which represents a donut object with properties `donut_name, taste_level `and `price`.

How would you define a variable to store the donut JSON String?

```scala
println("Step 1: How to escape a Json String")
val donutJson: String ="{"donut_name":"Glazed Donut","taste_level":"Very Tasty","price":2.50}"


```

**NOTE:**

- The Scala compiler will complain about the double quotes in the JSON field names.

### 2. Using backslash to escape quotes

If you have used another programming language like **Java** or **.NET** in the past, you would be familiar with **escaping quotes** in a String using **backslash** `\`

```scala
println("\nStep 2: Using backslash to escpae quotes")
val donutJson2: String ="{\"donut_name\":\"Glazed Donut\",\"taste_level\":\"Very Tasty\",\"price\":2.50}"
println(s"donutJson2 = $donutJson2")


```

You will see the output below when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: Using backslash to escpae quotes
donutJson2 = {"donut_name":"Glazed Donut","taste_level":"Very Tasty","price":2.50}


```

**NOTE:**

- As you can see from above, we were able to print a JSON String by making use of backslash `\`
- This is great but if you have longer text to escape, I'm sure you will get bored quite quickly : ) by having to escape each and every individual quote within your JSON String. So, let's see how to make this easier in Step 3 below.

### 3. Using triple quotes """ to escape characters

Fortunately Scala has a much better solution! To help you easily escape characters and symbols inside strings, you just need to wrap the text within** triple quotes** `"""<YOUR TEXT TO ESCAPE>"""` as follows:

```scala
println("\nStep 3: Using triple quotes \"\"\" to escape characters")
val donutJson3: String = """{"donut_name":"Glazed Donut","taste_level":"Very Tasty","price":2.50}"""
println(s"donutJson3 = $donutJson3")


```

You will see the output below when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: Using triple quotes """ to escape characters
donutJson3 = {"donut_name":"Glazed Donut","taste_level":"Very Tasty","price":2.50}


```

### 4. Creating multi-line text using stripMargin

As we've just seen in Step 3, using `"""` should be a clear winner on escaping quotes and other symbols! But, programmers in today's world demand much more :)

What if you would like to indent your text so that it's more readable? Look no further, Scala is here to help with the use of **stripMargin**:

```scala
val donutJson4: String =
    """
      |{
      |"donut_name":"Glazed Donut",
      |"taste_level":"Very Tasty",
      |"price":2.50
      |}
      """
   .stripMargin


```

You will see the output below when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4:  Creating multi-line text using stripMargin
donutJson4 = 
{
"donut_name":"Glazed Donut",
"taste_level":"Very Tasty",
"price":2.50
}

```

This concludes our tutorial on Scala - **How To Escape Characters and Create Multi-Line String** and I hope you've found it useful!

 

## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- How to assign a JSON String to a val.
- How to escape characters in a String using backslash
- How to escape characters using triple quotes
- How to create multi-line text using stripMargin

## 提示

- You can refer to the [Scala API documentation](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/#scala.collection.immutable.StringLike) to find more details about some function. If you look at the definition of the stripMargin function, you will see that it also takes in a parameter to allows you to specify a different character other than the default pipe `|`

```scala
println("\nTip: stripMargin using a different character")
val donutJson5: String =
"""
#{
#"donut_name":"Glazed Donut",
#"taste_level":"Very Tasty",
#"price":2.50
#}
""" .stripMargin('#')
println(s"donutJson5 = $donutJson4")


```

## 接下来是什么？

[下一节](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-overview-scala-type-inference/), I will go over how Scala is able to infer the types of our variables.
