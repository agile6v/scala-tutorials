# Learn How To Use While And Do While Loop


在本节, we will show how to iterate over some data points using the **while loop**construct. This is a continuation of our discussion from the previous tutorials on [For Comprehension](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-for-comprehension/) and [Ranges](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-range-inclusive-exclusive/).

 

If you are coming from a **Java** or** .NET** background, the **while** construct should be familiar. Just a reminder that from a **pure** **functional** perspective the use of loop such as the while loop is generally **less favoured**.

 

Instead, **fold** and **recursive** operations are preferred and if you do not know what these mean, that's OK! We will cover them in upcoming tutorials.

## 步骤

### 1. How to use while loop in Scala

Let's declare a **mutable** variable called **numberOfDonutsToBake** to represent the quantity of donuts that we need to bake :) We can then use a **while loop** and keep on decrementing the **numberOfDonutsToBake** variable by 1 after each iteration.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to use while loop in Scala")
var numberOfDonutsToBake = 10
while (numberOfDonutsToBake > 0) {
  println(s"Remaining donuts to be baked = $numberOfDonutsToBake")
  numberOfDonutsToBake -= 1
}

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Remaining donuts to be baked = 10
Remaining donuts to be baked = 9
Remaining donuts to be baked = 8
Remaining donuts to be baked = 7
Remaining donuts to be baked = 6
Remaining donuts to be baked = 5
Remaining donuts to be baked = 4
Remaining donuts to be baked = 3
Remaining donuts to be baked = 2
Remaining donuts to be baked = 1

```

**NOTE:**

- The **while loop** will stop when the condition numberOfDonutsToBake > 0 becomes true.
- Yes - we've used a **mutable** variable! And we know that mutation is a bad thing in [functional programming](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/scala-introduction/scala-functional-programming-features/)!
- Once again, there are better functional ways of achieving the same looping semantics using **fold** or **recursive** techniques.

### 2. How to use do while loop in Scala

If you have used another mainstream language like **Java** or **.NET**, I'm pretty sure that you would be familiar with `do while`.

The difference between a `while` construct from Step 1 versus a `do while` is that any expressions within the `do {}` will be ran at least once regardless of the condition within the `while()` clause.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to use do while loop in Scala")
var numberOfDonutsBaked = 0
do {
  numberOfDonutsBaked += 1
  println(s"Number of donuts baked = $numberOfDonutsBaked")
} while (numberOfDonutsBaked < 5)

```

 

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 2: How to use do while loop in Scala
Number of donuts baked = 1
Number of donuts baked = 2
Number of donuts baked = 3
Number of donuts baked = 4
Number of donuts baked = 5

```

This concludes our tutorial on **Learn How To Use While And Do While Loop** and I hope you've found it useful!

 

## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- How to use while loop in Scala
- How to use the do while loop in Scala

## 提示

- If you are new to **functional programming**, you can read more on the better alternatives to using loop such as [fold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fold_(higher-order_function)) and [tail recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call).
- If **fold** and **tail recursion** do not make any sense at the moment - it's perfectly fine! We will go over them in upcoming tutorials.
