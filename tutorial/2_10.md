# Learn How To Use Pattern Matching


在本节, we will show a **functional feature** of Scala which is **pattern marching**.

 

If you have used **Java** or **.NET** in the past, pattern matching may at first sight appear similar to switch statements. But, Scala's pattern matching is a lot more powerful!

## 步骤

**1. Pattern matching 101 - a very basic example**

Suppose you want to test a variable called **donutType**. In the case that its value is **Glazed Donut**, you will print **Very Tasty**. On the other hand, if its value is **Plain Donut**, then you will print **Tasty**.

```scala
println("Step 1: Pattern matching 101 - a very basic example")
val donutType = "Glazed Donut"
donutType match {
  case "Glazed Donut" => println("Very tasty")
  case "Plain Donut" => println("Tasty")
}

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 1: Pattern matching 101 - a very basic example
Very tasty

```

**NOTE:**

- You should have noticed that unlike in **Java** or in **.NET**, there are **no break**statements!
- I'm pretty sure that you must have seen your share of bugs which come from the fact that someone forgot to use the **break** clause. In **Java** or **.NET**, this would allow the logic to **fall-through** to the next case statement.
- Another big thanks to Scala as the compiler is smart enough to **prevent fall-through**and hence there is no need to use a break clause with pattern matching.

### 2. Pattern matching and return the result

What if instead of simply printing the different taste level of a donut, you would like to store it in a variable. Similar to what you've learned in [If And Else Expression](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-use-if-else-statement-expression/) and [For Comprehension](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-for-comprehension/), Scala's pattern matching can return the result back to the caller.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: Pattern matching and return the result")
val tasteLevel = donutType match {
  case "Glazed Donut" => "Very tasty"
  case "Plain Donut" => "Tasty"
}
println(s"Taste level of $donutType = $tasteLevel")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 2: Pattern matching and return the result
Taste level of Glazed Donut = Very tasty

```

**NOTE:**

- Notice that you did not have to use the **return** keyword as you would in say **Java** or **.NET**.
- Instead, the last expression will be the one returned back to the caller. We will see more return types as we get to tutorials on functions.

### 3. Pattern matching using the wildcard operator

As you have learned in Step 1, there is no need to use any break clauses as there is no fall-through when using pattern matching. But, what if you needed to provide a default case?

```scala
println("\nStep 3: Pattern matching using the wildcard operator")
val tasteLevel2 = donutType match {
  case "Glazed Donut" => "Very tasty"
  case "Plain Donut" => "Tasty"
  case _ => "Tasty"
}
println(s"Taste level of $donutType = $tasteLevel2")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 3: Pattern matching using the wildcard operator
Taste level of Glazed Donut = Very tasty

```

**NOTE:**

- If you come from a pure **Object Oriented** programming background, using the wildcard operator will almost certainly feel unnatural.
- Don't worry, we will see more examples of the wildcard operator in upcoming tutorials!

### 4. Pattern matching with two or more items on the same condition

In our example, we are labelling **Glazed Donut** item as **Very Tasty**. What if a **Strawberry Donut** was also **Very Tasty**. This behavior seems similar to an **OR** expression and you can use the pipe **|**

```scala
println("\nStep 4: Pattern matching with two or more items on the same condition")
val tasteLevel3 = donutType match {
  case "Glazed Donut" | "Strawberry Donut" => "Very tasty"
  case "Plain Donut" => "Tasty"
  case _ => "Tasty"
}
println(s"Taste level of $donutType = $tasteLevel3")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 4: Pattern matching with two or more items on the same condition
Taste level of Glazed Donut = Very tasty

```

### 5. Pattern matching and using if expressions in the case clause

Similar to Step 4, you can simulate an **OR** clause by adding [If Expression](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-use-if-else-statement-expression/) in the case statements.

```scala
println("\nStep 5; Pattern matching and using if expressions in the case clause")
val tasteLevel4 = donutType match {
  case donut if (donut.contains("Glazed") || donut.contains("Strawberry")) => "Very tasty"
  case "Plain Donut"  => "Tasty"
  case _  => "Tasty"
}
println(s"Taste level of $donutType = $tasteLevel4")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 5; Pattern matching and using if expressions in the case clause
Taste level of Glazed Donut = Very tasty

```

### 6. Pattern matching by types

So far we have been pattern matching on the value of some variable. What if you would like to **pattern match** on the **type** of the variable?

Let's declare a variable explicitly to be of type **Any** to hold the price of one donut. As you have learned in the [Type Inference tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-overview-scala-type-inference/), the Scala compiler would infer that **priceOfDonut** to be of type **Double**.

Let's use pattern matching to prove it!

```scala
println("\nStep 6: Pattern matching by types")
val priceOfDonut: Any = 2.50
val priceType = priceOfDonut match {
  case price: Int => "Int"
  case price: Double => "Double"
  case price: Float => "Float"
  case price: String => "String"
  case price: Boolean => "Boolean"
  case price: Char => "Char"
  case price: Long => "Long"
}
println(s"Donut price type = $priceType")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 6: Pattern matching by types
Donut price type = Double

```

**NOTE:**

- If you come from **Java** or **.NET**, you can think of the **Any** type similar to the **Object**class.
- In other words, **Any **is at the root of Scala's type hierarchy as shown per the [Scala Documentation](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/unified-types.html).
