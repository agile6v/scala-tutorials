# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Aggregate Function


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **aggregate** function on collection data structures in Scala. The aggregate function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/)collection data structures.

 

The **aggregate** method aggregates results by first applying a sequence operation which is its first parameter and then uses a **combine** operator to combine the results produced by the sequence operation.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **aggregate** method is as follows:

```scala
def aggregate[B](z: =>B)(seqop: (B, A) => B, combop: (B, B) => B): B = foldLeft(z)(seqop)

```

 

The **aggregate** method is a member of the [TraversableOnce](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableOnce.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Set of type String to represent Donut elements 

The code below shows how to initialize a Set of type String which we will use to represent a basket of Donut elements.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Set of type String to represent Donut elements")
val donutBasket1: Set[String] = Set("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut")
println(s"Elements of donutBasket1 = $donutBasket1")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Set of type String to represent Donut elements
Elements of donutBasket1 = Set(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to define an accumulator function to calculate the total length of the String elements

The code below shows how to define an accumulator function which we will use to calculate the total length for all the Donut elements.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to define an accumulator function to calculate the total length of the String elements")
val donutLengthAccumulator: (Int, String) => Int = (accumulator, donutName) => accumulator + donutName.length


```

**NOTE:**

- We are making use of a [Value Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/).

### 3. How to call aggregate function with the accumulator function from Step 2

The code below shows how to pass the accumulator value function from Step 2 to the **aggregate** method in order to calculate the total length of the Donut elements.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to call aggregate function with the accumulator function from Step 2")
val totalLength = donutBasket1.aggregate(0)(donutLengthAccumulator, _ + _)
println(s"Total length of elements in donutBasket1 = $totalLength")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to call aggregate function with the accumulator function from Step 2
Total length of elements in donutBasket1 = 27

```

 

### 4. How to initialize a Set of Tuple3 elements to represent Donut name, price and quantity

The code below shows how to create a Set of Donut elements where each Donut elements is a **Tuple3** to represent the donut's name, price and quantity.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to initialize a Set of Tuple3 elements to represent Donut name, price and quantity")
val donutBasket2: Set[(String, Double, Int)] = Set(("Plain Donut", 1.50, 10), ("Strawberry Donut", 2.0, 10))
println(s"Elements of donutBasket2 = $donutBasket2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to initialize a Set of Tuple3 elements to represent Donut name, price and quantity
Elements of donutBasket2 = Set((Plain Donut,1.5,10), (Strawberry Donut,2.0,10))

```

**NOTE:**

- You can review the [tutorial on Tuples](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-tuples-pattern-match/) if you are not familiar with it.

### 5. How to define an accumulator function to calculate the total cost of Donuts

The code below shows how to define an **accumulator** [Value Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/) which we will use to calculate the total cost for all donuts.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to define an accumulator function to calculate the total cost of Donuts")
val totalCostAccumulator: (Double, Double, Int) => Double = (accumulator, price, quantity) => accumulator + (price * quantity)

```

 

### 6. How to call aggregate function with accumulator function from Step 5

The code below shows how to pass-through the** accumulator function** from Step 5 to the **aggregate** method in order to calculator the total cost for all the donut elements in the Set.

```scala
println("\nStep 6: How to call aggregate function with accumulator function from Step 5")
val totalCost = donutBasket2.aggregate(0.0)((accumulator: Double, tuple: (String, Double, Int)) => totalCostAccumulator(accumulator, tuple._2, tuple._3), _ + _)
println(s"Total cost of donuts in donutBasket2 = $totalCost")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 6: How to call aggregate function with accumulator function from Step 5
Total cost of donuts in donutBasket2 = 35.0

```
