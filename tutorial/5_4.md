# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Extend Multiple Traits


在本节, we will learn how to create **traits with type parameters **and show how to have a class extend** multiple traits **by making use of the **with** keyword.

 

We will update the examples from the previous tutorials on [Learn How To Create And Extend Trait](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-extend-trait/) and [Learn How to Create Trait With Type Parameters](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-trait-type-parameters/).

## 步骤

### 1. Create a trait which will define the methods for a data access layer

Let's start with defining a simple **trait** called DonutShoppingCartDao and it will provide the method signatures to represent a [Data Access Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_layer).

```scala
println("Step 1: Create a trait with type which will define the methods for a data access layer")
trait DonutShoppingCartDao[A] {

 def add(donut: A): Long

 def update(donut: A): Boolean

 def search(donut: A): A

 def delete(donut: A): Boolean

}

```

**NOTE:**

- The trait is defined with type parameter DonutShoppingCartDao**[A]**. If you are unsure about type parameters, please review the [previous tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-trait-type-parameters/).

### 2. Create a second trait which will define the methods for checking donut inventory

Next, we create another trait called DonutInventoryService[A] which encapsulates methods to query donut inventories such as checkStockQuantity() method.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: Create a second trait which will define the methods for checking donut inventory")
trait DonutInventoryService[A] {

 def checkStockQuantity(donut: A): Int

}

```

**NOTE:**

- Trait DonutInventoryService**[A]** is also defined with type parameter.

### 3. Create a DonutShoppingCart class which extends multiple traits namely trait DonutShoppingCartDao and trait DonutInventoryService

We then define a class named DonutShoppingCart[A] which extends both the traits DonutShoppingCartDao[A]  and DonutInventoryService[A] as shown below.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: Create a DonutShoppingCart class which extends multiple traits namely trait DonutShoppingCartDao and trait DonutInventoryService")
class DonutShoppingCart[A] extends DonutShoppingCartDao[A] with DonutInventoryService[A] {

 override def add(donut: A): Long = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCart-> add method -> donut: $donut")
  1
 }

 override def update(donut: A): Boolean = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCart-> update method -> donut: $donut")
  true
 }

 override def search(donut: A): A = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCart-> search method -> donut: $donut")
  donut
 }

 override def delete(donut: A): Boolean = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCart-> delete method -> donut: $donut")
  true
 }

 override def checkStockQuantity(donut: A): Int = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCart-> checkStockQuantity method -> donut: $donut")
  10
 }
}

```

**NOTE:**

- We've made use of the **with** keyword to extend multiple traits.

### 4. Create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods

You can now create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods which were inherited from trait DonutShoppingCartDao[A]

```scala
println("\nStep 4: Create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods")
val donutShoppingCart: DonutShoppingCart[String] = new DonutShoppingCart[String]()
donutShoppingCart.add("Vanilla Donut")
donutShoppingCart.update("Vanilla Donut")
donutShoppingCart.search("Vanilla Donut")
donutShoppingCart.delete("Vanilla Donut")

```

**NOTE:**

- To keep the example simple, we are passing a type of String although in a real world application you would most likely have custom [type classes](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-type-class/).

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 4: Create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods
DonutShoppingCart-> add method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
DonutShoppingCart-> update method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
DonutShoppingCart-> search method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
DonutShoppingCart-> delete method -> donut: Vanilla Donut

```

 

### 5. Call the checkStockQuantity method which was inherited from trait DonutInventoryService

Since class DonutShoppingCart also extended the second trait DonutInventoryService[A], you also have access to the checkStockQuantity() method as shown below.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: Call the checkStockQuantity method which was inherited from trait DonutInventoryService")
donutShoppingCart.checkStockQuantity("Vanilla Donut")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 5: Call the checkStockQuantity method which was inherited from trait DonutInventoryService
DonutShoppingCart-> checkStockQuantity method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
```

This concludes our tutorial on **Learn How To Extend Multiple Traits **and I hope you've found it useful!

 


## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- Create a trait which will define the methods for a data access layer
- Create a second trait which will define the methods for checking donut inventory
- Create a DonutShoppingCart class which extends multiple traits namely trait DonutShoppingCartDao and trait DonutInventoryService
- Create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods
- Call the checkStockQuantity method which was inherited from trait DonutInventoryService

## 提示

- We've kept the **trait type parameters** example simple but it would be good to review variance namely [covariance](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-variance-covariance/) and [contra-variance](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-variance-contra-variance-2/) type parameters.
- In upcoming tutorials in this Chapter, we will also show how to use **traits** to build some pure **Functional Programming** constructs such as [Monoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid) and [Functors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor) and much more!
