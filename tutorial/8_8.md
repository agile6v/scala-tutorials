# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Filter And FilterNot Functions


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **filter** and **filterNot** functions on collection data structures in Scala. The **filter** and **filterNot** functions are applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/)and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **filter** method takes a predicate function as its parameter and uses it to select all the elements in the collection which **matches** the predicate. It will return a new collection with elements that matched the predicate.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **filter** method is as follows:

```scala
def filter(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): Repr

```

 

The **filterNot** method is similar to the filter method except that it will create a new collection with elements that **do not match** the predicate function.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **filterNot** method is as follows:

```scala
def filterNot(p: (A) ⇒ Boolean): Repr

```

 

The **filter **and **filterNot** method is a member of the [TraversableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of Donut elements of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut", "Vanilla Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut, Vanilla Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to keep only Plain and Glazed Donuts using the filter method

The code below shows how to use the **filter** method to find Plain and Glazed donut elements in the Sequence and return a new collection which contains only these donut elements.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to keep only Plain and Glazed Donuts using the filter method")
val sequenceWithPlainAndGlazedDonut = donuts.filter { donutName =>
  donutName.contains("Plain") || donutName.contains("Glazed")
}
println(s"Sequence with Plain and Glazed donuts only = $sequenceWithPlainAndGlazedDonut")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to keep only Plain and Glazed Donuts using the filter method
Sequence with Plain and Glazed donuts only = List(Plain Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

### 3. How to filter out element Vanilla Donut using the filterNot function

The code below shows how to use **filterNot** to filter out Vanilla Donut element from the donut sequence and return a new donut sequence which does not contain element Vanilla Donut.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to filter out element Vanilla Donut using the filterNot function")
val sequenceWithoutVanillaDonut = donuts.filterNot(donutName => donutName == "Vanilla Donut" )
println(s"Sequence without vanilla donut = $sequenceWithoutVanillaDonut")

```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to filter out element Vanilla Donut using the filterNot function
Sequence without vanilla donut = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```
