# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Map Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **map** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **map** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/)collection data structures.

 

The **map** method takes a predicate function and applies it to every element in the collection. It creates a new collection with the result of the predicate function applied to each and every element of the collection.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **map** method is as follows:

```scala
def map[B](f: (A) â‡’ B): Traversable[B]

```

 

The **map** method is a member of the [TraverableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableLike.html) trait but there are specialized versions of the **map** methods for given collection types.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of donut elements where each element in the Sequence is of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts1: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain", "Strawberry", "Glazed")
println(s"Elements of donuts1 = $donuts1")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts1 = List(Plain, Strawberry, Glazed)

```

 

### 2. How to append the word Donut to each element using the map function

The code below shows how to use the **map** method to append the String Donut to each donut element in the Sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to append the word Donut to each element using the map function")
val donuts2: Seq[String] = donuts1.map(_ + " Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to append the word Donut to each element using the map function
Elements of donuts2 = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

**NOTE:**

- We've used the wildcard operator **_ **inside the **map** method.

### 3. How to create a donut sequence with one None element

The code below shows how another donut Sequence but which also contains a [None](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-option-avoid-null/)element.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to create a donut sequence with one None element")
val donuts3: Seq[AnyRef] = Seq("Plain", "Strawberry", None)
donuts3.foreach(println(_))


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to create a donut sequence with one None element
Plain
Strawberry
None

```

 

### 4. How to filter out the None element using map function

The code below shows how to use the **map** method along with [pattern matching](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-pattern-matching/) to filter out the [None](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-option-avoid-null/) element in the Donut sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to filter out the None element using map function")
val donuts4: Seq[String] = donuts3.map {
 case donut: String => donut + " Donut"
 case None => "Unknown Donut"
}
println(s"Elements of donuts4 = $donuts4")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to filter out the None element using map function
Elements of donuts4 = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Unknown Donut)

```

 

### 5. How to define couple of functions which returns an Option of type String

The code below shows how to define two function both of which return an [Option](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-function-return-type/) of type String which represent either a Donut or None.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to define couple of functions which returns an Option of type String")
def favoriteDonut: Option[String] = Some("Glazed Donut")

def leastFavoriteDonut: Option[String] = None


```

### 6. How to use map function to filter out None values

The code below shows how to use the **map** method to filter out None values from function return values.

```scala
println("\nStep 6: How to use map function to filter out None values")
favoriteDonut.map(donut => println(s"Favorite donut = $donut"))
leastFavoriteDonut.map(donut=> println(s"Least favorite donut = $donut"))


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 6: How to use map function to filter out None values
Favorite donut = Glazed Donut

```

**NOTE:**

- When **leastFavoriteDonut** function is called, nothing is printed because the **map**method has already filtered out None values.
