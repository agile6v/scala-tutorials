# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Foreach Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **foreach** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **foreach** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **foreach** method takes a function as parameter and applies it to every element in the collection. As an example, you can use **foreach** method to loop through all elements in a collection.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **foreach** method is as follows:

```scala
def foreach(f: (A) â‡’ Unit): Unit

```

 

The **foreach **method is a member of the [IterableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/IterableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a sequence of donut elements where each element in the sequence is of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to loop through all the elements in the sequence using the foreach function

The code below shows how to loop through all elements in the donut sequence using the **foreach** method.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to loop through all the elements in the sequence using the foreach function")
donuts.foreach(println(_))


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to loop through all the elements in the sequence using the foreach function
Plain Donut
Strawberry Donut
Glazed Donut

```

**NOTE:**

- Note that we are making use of the wildcard operator **_** in the **println** method.

### 3. How to loop through and access all the elements in the sequence using the foreach function

The code below shows how to loop through and access all elements in the sequence using the **foreach** method.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to loop through and access all the elements in the sequence using the foreach function")
donuts.foreach(donutName => println(s"donutName = $donutName"))


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to loop through and access all the elements in the sequence using the foreach function
donutName = Plain Donut
donutName = Strawberry Donut
donutName = Glazed Donut

```

 

### 4. How to declare a value function to format a donut names into upper case format

The code below shows how to declare a [Value Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/) which will format each donut name into uppercase.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to declare a value function to format a donut names into upper case format")
val uppercase: (String) => String = (s) => {
 val upper = s.toUpperCase
 println(upper)
 upper
}
println(s"Value function formatting donut names to uppercase = $uppercase")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to declare a value function to format a donut names into upper case format
Value function formatting donut names to uppercase = <function1>

```

 

### 5. How to format all donuts to uppercase using value function from Step 4

The code below shows how to use the [Value Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/) from Step 4 and pass it through the **foreach** method in order to format each donut name into uppercase.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to format all donuts to uppercase using value function from Step 4")
donuts.foreach(uppercase)


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 5: How to format all donuts to uppercase using value function from Step 4
PLAIN DONUT
STRAWBERRY DONUT
GLAZED DONUT

```
