# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Drop Function


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **drop** function on collection data structures in Scala. The **drop** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **drop** method takes an integer parameter N and will return a new collection that does not contain the first N elements.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **drop** method is as follows:

```scala
def drop(n: Int): Repr 

```

 

The **drop** method is a member of the [IterableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/IterableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of Donut elements of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to drop the first element using drop function

The code below shows how to remove the first element from the Donut Sequence by using the **drop** method.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to drop the first element using drop function")
println(s"Drop the first element in the sequence = ${donuts.drop(1)}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to drop the first element using drop function
Drop the first element in the sequence = List(Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 3. How to drop the first two elements using the drop function

The code below shows how to remove the first two elements from the Donut Sequence by using the **drop** method.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to drop the first two elements using the drop function")
println(s"Drop the first and second elements in the sequence = ${donuts.drop(2)}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to drop the first two elements using the drop function
Drop the first and second elements in the sequence = List(Glazed Donut)

```

**NOTE:**

- As per the examples in Step 1 and Step 2, it should be fairly obvious that the **drop**method allows you to drop the **first** **N** **elements** from a given collection, where N is specified by the parameter of the **drop** method.
