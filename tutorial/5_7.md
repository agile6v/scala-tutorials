# Scala Tutorial - Traits, Companion Object, Factory Pattern


在本节, we will learn how to use **traits** and **companion objects** to implement a [Factory Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern).

 

We will build on what we have learned from the previous tutorials:

- [Learn How To Create And Extend Trait](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-extend-trait/)
- [Learn How to Create Trait With Type Parameters](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-trait-type-parameters/)
- [Learn How To Extend Multiple Traits](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-extend-multiple-traits/)
- [Learn How to Use Traits for Dependency Injection Part 1](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-traits-depedency-injection/)
- [Learn How To Use Trait For Dependency Injection Part 2 Avoid Cake Pattern](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-traits-depedency-injection-avoid-cake-pattern/)

## 步骤

### 1. Define a wrapper object called Cakes to hold various types of cakes

We will start by creating an **object** named **Cakes** as a convenient way to hold various kinds of cakes (see Step 1 in code snippet below).

 

Next, we define a **trait** name **Cake** which will expose the methods for a Cake. In our simple example, each Cake will have a method called **name** which returns a type of String (see Step 2 in code snippet below).

 

With the Cake trait defined, we can extend it to create various types of cakes. In the example below, we've defined a **Cupcake**, **Donut** and **UnknownCake** **classes** which extend the **Cake** **trait **(see Step 3 in code snippet below).

```scala
// Step 1: Define a wrapper object called Cakes to hold various types of cakes
object Cakes {

 // Step 2: Define a base trait to represent a Cake
 trait Cake {
   def name: String
 }

 // Step 3: Define class implementations for the Cake trait namely: Cupcake, Donut and UnknownCake
 class UnknownCake extends Cake {
   override def name: String = "Unknown Cake ... but still delicious!"
 }

 class Cupcake extends Cake {
   override def name: String = "Cupcake"
  }

 class Donut extends Cake {
   override def name: String = "Donut"
  }

 }

```

**NOTE:**

- Review the [tutorial on objects](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-declare-value-fields-companion-object/) if you are not familiar with it.

### 2. Define another object with an apply() method as factory for types of cakes

We create another object named **CakeFactory** and it will be a convenient wrapper for our **factory pattern** (see Step 4 in code snippet below).

 

Finally, we defined an [apply() method](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-companion-objects-factory-apply-method-inheritance/) which will [Pattern Match](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-pattern-matching/) on String and return an actual corresponding **Cake implementation **(see Step 5 in code snippet below).

```scala
// Step 4: Define a wrapper object called CakeFactory")
object CakeFactory {
 import Cakes._

 // Step 5: Define an apply method which will act as a factory to produce the correct Cake implementation
 def apply(cake: String): Cake = {
   cake match {
    case "cupcake" => new Cupcake
    case "donut" => new Donut
    case _ => new UnknownCake
   }
  }
 }

```

**NOTE:**

- In a real application, you would perhaps want to control the types of cakes and pattern match on an [enum](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/learn-to-create-use-enumerations/) as opposed to a String. In upcoming tutorial, I will show you how to use **sealed traits** to define enum.

### 3. Call the CakeFactory

Calling the CakeFactory is pretty easy by simply passing a String type as defined in the apply method from Step 2.

```scala
// Step 6: Call the CakeFactory
println(s"A cupcake = ${CakeFactory("cupcake").name}")
println(s"A donut = ${CakeFactory("donut").name}")
println(s"Unknown cake = ${CakeFactory("coconut tart").name}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
A cupcake = Cupcake
A donut = Donut
Unknown cake = Unknown Cake ... but still delicious!

```

 

This concludes our tutorial on **Traits, Companion Object, Factory Pattern **and I hope you've found it useful!

 


## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- Define a wrapper object called Cakes to hold various types of cakes
- Define another object with an apply() method as factory for types of cakes
- Call the CakeFactory

## 提示

- We've kept the **trait type parameters** example simple but it would be good to review variance namely [covariance](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-variance-covariance/) and [contra-variance](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-variance-contra-variance-2/) type parameters.
- In upcoming tutorials in this Chapter, we will also show how to use **traits** to build some pure **Functional Programming** constructs such as [Monoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid) and [Functors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor) and much more!
