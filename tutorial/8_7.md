# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Exists Function


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **exists** function on collection data structures in Scala. The **exists** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **exists** method takes a predicate function and will use it to find the first element in the collection which matches the predicate.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **exists** method is as follows:

```scala
def exists(p: (A) â‡’ Boolean): Boolean

```

 

The **exists** method is a member of the [IterableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/IterableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of Donut elements of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to check if a particular element exists in the sequence using the exists function

The code below shows how to use the **exists** method to find if a particular element exists in a sequence - more precisely if donut element Plain Donut exists in the donut sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to check if a particular element exists in the sequence using the exists function")
val doesPlainDonutExists: Boolean = donuts.exists(donutName => donutName == "Plain Donut")
println(s"Does Plain Donut exists = $doesPlainDonutExists")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to check if a particular element exists in the sequence using the exists function
Does Plain Donut exists = true

```

 

### 3. How to declare a predicate value function for the exists function

The code below shows how to declare a predicate value function to find if a Plain Donut element exists in a sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to declare a predicate value function for the exists function")
val plainDonutPredicate: (String) => Boolean = (donutName) => donutName == "Plain Donut"
println(s"Value function plainDonutPredicate = $plainDonutPredicate")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to declare a predicate value function for the exists function
Value function plainDonutPredicate = <function1>

```

**NOTE:**

- The predicate function is a [Value Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/).

### 4. How to find element Plain Donut using the exists function and passing through the predicate function from Step 3

The code below shows how to call the **exists **method and pass-through the value predicate function from Step 3 to find if a Plain Donut element exists in the donut sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to find element Plain Donut using the exists function and passing through the predicate function from Step 3")
println(s"Does Plain Donut exists = ${donuts.exists(plainDonutPredicate)}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to find element Plain Donut using the exists function and passing through the predicate function from Step 3
Does Plain Donut exists = true

```

 

### 5.How to declare a predicate def function for the exists function

The code below shows how to a predicate def function to find if a Plain Donut element exists in a sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to declare a predicate def function for the exists function")
def plainDonutPredicateFunction(donutName: String): Boolean = donutName == "Plain Donut"


```

### 6. How to find element Plain Donut using the exists function and passing through the predicate def function from Step 5

The code below shows how to call the **exists **method and pass-through the def predicate function from Step 5 to find if a Plain Donut element exists in the donut sequence.

```scala
println("\nStep 6: How to find element Plain Donut using the exists function and passing through the predicate function from Step 5")
println(s"Does plain Donut exists = ${donuts.exists(plainDonutPredicateFunction(_))}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 6: How to find element Plain Donut using the exists function and passing through the predicate function from Step 5
Does plain Donut exists = true

```
