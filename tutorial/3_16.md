# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Create Function Using The Val Keyword Instead Of Def

在本节, we will learn how to create value functions which are defined using the **val**keyword as opposed to using the **def** keyword.

 

In addition, we will show how to pass through the **val** function to a [Higher Order Function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-higher-order-function-parameter/).

## 步骤

### 1. How to define a higher order function which takes another function as parameter

Let's review the function totalCostWithDiscountFunctionParameter() which we used in the [Higher Order Function tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-higher-order-function-parameter/).

```scala
println("\nStep 1: How to define a higher order function which takes another function as parameter")
def totalCostWithDiscountFunctionParameter(donutType: String)(quantity: Int)(f: Double => Double): Double = {
  println(s"Calculating total cost for $quantity $donutType")
  val totalCost = 2.50 * quantity
  f(totalCost)
}

```

**NOTE:**

- The function has a **by-name** parameter which is expected to be a function that has a parameter of type Double and will also return a type of Double.
- The **by-name** parameter function will apply some discount to the totalCost value.

### 2. How to define and pass a def function to a higher order function

Let's also review how we defined a discount function using the **def** keyword and passed it to the Higher Order Function totalCostWithDiscountFunctionParameter()

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to define and pass a def function to a higher order function")
def applyDiscount(totalCost: Double): Double = {
  val discount = 2 // assume you fetch discount from database
  totalCost - discount
}
println(s"Total cost of 5 Glazed Donuts with discount def function = ${totalCostWithDiscountFunctionParameter("Glazed Donut")(5)(applyDiscount(_))}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 2: How to define and pass a def function to a higher order function
Calculating total cost for 5 Glazed Donut
Total cost of 5 Glazed Donuts with discount def function = 10.5

```

 

### 3. How to define and pass a val function to a higher order function

If you've also reviewed the [Scala Features Tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/scala-introduction/scala-functional-programming-features/), you should already be familiar with the fact that **functions** are **first class citizens** in Scala.

 

As a result, Scala allows you to define value function using the **val** keyword as shown below:

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to define and pass a val function to a higher order function")
val applyDiscountValueFunction = (totalCost: Double) => {
  val discount = 2 // assume you fetch discount from database
  totalCost - discount
}
println(s"Total cost of 5 Glazed Donuts with discount val function = ${totalCostWithDiscountFunctionParameter("Glazed Donut")(5)(applyDiscountValueFunction)}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 3: How to define and pass a val function to a higher order function
Calculating total cost for 5 Glazed Donut
Total cost of 5 Glazed Donuts with discount val function = 10.5

```

**NOTE:**

- The syntax for defining value function is slightly different to functions defined with def keyword.
- In `val applyDiscountValueFunction = (totalCost: Double) => { ... }` we did not specify the return type of the function and are making use of [Scala Type Inference](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-overview-scala-type-inference/).
- If you want to add the return type, the syntax for the value function would look as follows: `val applyDiscountValueFunction: Double => Double =totalCost => { ... }`
- When passing the value function to the Higher Order Function, you no longer need to explicitly make use of the **wildcard** **operator** **_**

This concludes our tutorial on **Learn How To Create Function Using The Val Keyword Instead Of Def **and I hope you've found it useful!


## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- How to define a higher order function which takes another function as parameter
- How to define and pass a def function to a higher order function
- How to define and pass a val function to a higher order function

## 提示

- You can learn more about call-by-name function parameters from [the Scala specification](http://www.scala-lang.org/files/archive/spec/2.11/06-expressions.html#function-applications).
- **val** functions are instances of **FunctionN** classes and if you look at the [Scala documentation for say Function1 class](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/rc2/scala/Function1.html), you will notice that **val** function will inherit other methods such as **andThen** or **compose** which allow for **function composition**.
