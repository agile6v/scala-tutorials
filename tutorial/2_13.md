# Learn The Scala Class And Type Hierarchy


## Overview

在本节, we will have a closer look at **Scala's type hierarchy**. To help you visualize the type hierarchy in Scala, you can refer to the diagram below which is a snapshot from [Scala's documentation on Unified Types](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/unified-types.html).

The diagram shows that the type **Any** is at the top most of the Scala's class hierarchy.

 

If you are coming from **Java** or **.NET**, you can think of the **Any** type as the Object class. In other words, **Any **is the root type and it has two sub-classes namely **AnyVal** and **AnyRef **as per the above diagram.

 

So where are the built-in primitive types such as the ones we have in Java? The answer is simple, there are none!

## 步骤

### 1. Declare a variable of type Any

If you recall from the previous [Type Inference tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-overview-scala-type-inference/), Scala is able to infer types.

But in this example let's type our immutable variable **favoriteDonut** as Any.

```scala
println("Step 1: Declare a variable of type Any")
val favoriteDonut: Any = "Glazed Donut"
println(s"favoriteDonut of type Any = $favoriteDonut")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 1: Declare a variable of type Any
favoriteDonut of type Any = Glazed Donut

```

### 2. Declare a variable of type AnyRef

Let's declare another variable called **donutName**. But this time you will use the type **AnyRef**.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: Declare a variable of type AnyRef")
val donutName: AnyRef = "Glazed Donut"
println(s"donutName of type AnyRef = $donutName")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 2: Declare a variable of type AnyRef
donutName of type AnyRef = Glazed Donut

```

### 3. Declare a variable of type AnyVal

Let's now declare another variable **donutPrice** to be of type **AnyVal** and assign its value to 2.50.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: Declare a variable of type AnyVal")
val donutPrice: AnyVal = 2.50
println(s"donutPrice of type AnyVal = $donutPrice")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 3: Declare a variable of type AnyVal
AnyVal donutPrice = 2.5

```

This concludes our tutorial on** Learn The Scala Class And Type Hierarchy** and I hope you've found it useful!


## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- How to declare a variable of type Any
- How to declare a variable of type AnyRef
- How to declare a variable of type AnyVal

## 提示

- Don't forget that as we showed in the [Pattern Matching tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-pattern-matching/) that you can pattern match on the type of your variable to determine its type.
- This tutorial was inspired by [Scala documentation on Class Hierarchy](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/unified-types.html). You can refer to it for additional details.
