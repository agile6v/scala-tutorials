# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Last Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **last** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **last** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/)collection data structures.

 

The **last** method will return the last element in a collection.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **last** method is as follows:

```scala
def last: A

```

 

The last** **method is a member of the [TraversableLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of donut elements where each element in the Sequence is of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to access the last element of the donut sequence by index

The code below shows how to access the last element of the donut Sequence by using the last element's index.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to access the last element of the donut sequence by index")
println(s"Last element of donut sequence = ${donuts(donuts.size - 1)}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to access the last element of the donut sequence by index
Last element of donut sequence = Glazed Donut

```

**NOTE:**

- Using the element's index is typically how you would access the last element in the Sequence in an imperative language such as Java or .NET

### 3. How to access the last element of the donut sequence by using the last function

The code below shows how to access the last element of the donut sequence in a more functional style by making use of the last method.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to access the last element of the donut sequence by using the last function")
println(s"Last element of donut sequence = ${donuts.last}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to access the last element of the donut sequence by using the last function
Last element of donut sequence = Glazed Donut

```

 

### 4. How to create an empty sequence

The code below shows how to create an empty Sequence of type String.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to create an empty sequence")
val donuts2: Seq[String] = Seq.empty[String]
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to create an empty sequence")
val donuts2: Seq[String] = Seq.empty[String]
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")

```

 

### 5. How to access the last element of the donut sequence using the lastOption function

The code below shows how to access the last element of a donut sequence by making use of the **lastOption** method. You should prefer to use the **lastOption** method if you are unsure that a last element exists in a collection.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to access the last element of the donut sequence using the lastOption function")
println(s"Last element of empty sequence = ${donuts2.lastOption.getOrElse("No donut was found!")}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 5: How to access the last element of the donut sequence using the lastOption function
Last element of empty sequence = No donut was found!

```
