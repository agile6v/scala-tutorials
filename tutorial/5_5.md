# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Traits For Dependency Injection


在本节, we will learn how to use traits for **dependency injection** using the standard Scala library and without having to import any third party tools and libraries.

 

We will build on what we have learned from the previous tutorials on [Learn How To Create And Extend Trait](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-extend-trait/), [Learn How to Create Trait With Type Parameters](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-trait-type-parameters/) and [Learn How To Extend Multiple Traits](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-extend-multiple-traits/).

## 步骤

### 1. Create a trait which knows how to do create, read, update and delete operations CRUD to a given database

Let's start with defining a **trait** called DonutDatabase which will provide the method signatures to represent a [Data Access Layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_layer).

```scala
println("Step 1: Create a trait which knows how to do create, read, update and delete operations CRUD to a given database")
trait DonutDatabase[A] {

 def addOrUpdate(donut: A): Long

 def query(donut: A): A

 def delete(donut: A): Boolean
}

```

**NOTE:**

- The trait is defined with type parameter DonutDatabase**[A]**. If you are unsure about type parameters, please review the [previous tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/scala-trait-type-parameters/).

### 2. Create a class which extends trait DonutDatabase and knows how to perform CRUD operations with Apache Cassandra as storage layer

Let's assume that our storage layer is [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/). We create a class called CassandraDonutStore[A] which will facilitate all the CRUD operations by **extending** trait DonutDatabase[A] from step 1.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: Create a class which extends trait DonutDatabase and knows how to perform CRUD operations with Apache Cassandra as storage layer")
class CassandraDonutStore[A] extends DonutDatabase[A] {

 override def addOrUpdate(donut: A): Long = {
  println(s"CassandraDonutDatabase-> addOrUpdate method -> donut: $donut")
  1
 }

 override def query(donut: A): A = {
  println(s"CassandraDonutDatabase-> query method -> donut: $donut")
  donut
 }

 override def delete(donut: A): Boolean = {
  println(s"CassandraDonutDatabase-> delete method -> donut: $donut")
  true
 }
}

```

 

### 3. Create a trait which will define the methods for a data access layer and will require dependency injection for DonutDatabase

Next, we create a trait called DonutShoppingCartDao which will be the main API to perform CRUD operations versus some storage layer. To this end, we define a val of type DonutDatabase[A] which will be injected as shown below.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: Create a trait which will define the methods for a data access layer and will require dependency injection for DonutDatabase")
trait DonutShoppingCartDao[A] {

 val donutDatabase: DonutDatabase[A] // dependency injection

 def add(donut: A): Long = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCartDao-> add method -> donut: $donut")
  donutDatabase.addOrUpdate(donut)
 }

 def update(donut: A): Boolean = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCartDao-> update method -> donut: $donut")
  donutDatabase.addOrUpdate(donut)
  true
 }

 def search(donut: A): A = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCartDao-> search method -> donut: $donut")
  donutDatabase.query(donut)
 }

 def delete(donut: A): Boolean = {
  println(s"DonutShoppingCartDao-> delete method -> donut: $donut")
  donutDatabase.delete(donut)
 }

}

```

**NOTE:**

- By defining: **val donutDatabase: DonutDatabase[A]**, we are not tying ourselves with any particular storage layer. Instead, the class DonutShoppingCartDao only mandates a type of DonutDatabase[A].
- [In the previous example](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/), we have only seen traits which had method signatures. Scala allows traits to also contain **method implementations **as shown above.

### 4. Create a trait which will define the methods for checking donut inventory and will require dependency injection for DonutDatabase

Similar to the [previous examples](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-5-traits/), we create another trait which will be responsible to checking donut inventory.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: Create a trait which will define the methods for checking donut inventory and will require dependency injection for DonutDatabase")
trait DonutInventoryService[A] {

 val donutDatabase: DonutDatabase[A] // dependency injection

 def checkStockQuantity(donut: A): Int = {
  println(s"DonutInventoryService-> checkStockQuantity method -> donut: $donut")
  donutDatabase.query(donut)
  1
 }

}

```

**NOTE:**

- Trait DonutInventoryService[A] also mandates a type DonutDatabase: **val donutDatabase: DonutDatabase[A]**

### 5. Create a trait which will act as a facade and extends multiple traits namely trait DonutShoppingCartDao and trait DonutInventoryService. 

We now create a **facade** which extends multiple traits namely trait DonutShoppingCartDao and trait DonutInventoryService. We also **inject** an implementation of our storage layer which in this case is an instance of **CassandraDonutStore**

```scala
println("\nStep 5: Create a trait which will act as a facade which extends multiple traits namely trait DonutShoppingCartDao and trait DonutInventoryService. It also inject the correct DonutDatabase implementation - a CassandraDonutStore")
trait DonutShoppingCartServices[A] extends DonutShoppingCartDao[A] with DonutInventoryService[A] {
 override val donutDatabase: DonutDatabase[A] = new CassandraDonutStore[A]()
}

```

**NOTE:**

- We made use of the **override val** keywords.

### 6. Create a DonutShoppingCart class which extends a single facade named DonutShoppingCartServices to expose all the underlying features required by a DonutShoppingCart

With the **facade** DonutShoppingCartServices[A] defined in Step 5, we can now create a class DonutShoppingCart[A] which extends it.

```scala
println("\nStep 6: Create a DonutShoppingCart class which extends a single facade named DonutShoppingCartServices to expose all the underlying features required by a DonutShoppingCart")
 class DonutShoppingCart[A] extends DonutShoppingCartServices[A] {

}

```

 

### 7. Create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods

You can now create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods which were inherited from trait DonutShoppingCartDao.

```scala
println("\nStep 7: Create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods")
val donutShoppingCart: DonutShoppingCart[String] = new DonutShoppingCart[String]()
donutShoppingCart.add("Vanilla Donut")
donutShoppingCart.update("Vanilla Donut")
donutShoppingCart.search("Vanilla Donut")
donutShoppingCart.delete("Vanilla Donut")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 7: Create an instance of DonutShoppingCart and call the add, update, search and delete methods
DonutShoppingCartDao-> add method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
CassandraDonutDatabase-> addOrUpdate method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
DonutShoppingCartDao-> update method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
CassandraDonutDatabase-> addOrUpdate method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
DonutShoppingCartDao-> search method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
CassandraDonutDatabase-> query method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
DonutShoppingCartDao-> delete method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
CassandraDonutDatabase-> delete method -> donut: Vanilla Donut

```

 

### 8. Call the checkStockQuantity method

You can now call the checkStockQuantity() method which was inherited from trait DonutInventoryService.

```scala
println("\nStep 8: Call the checkStockQuantity method")
donutShoppingCart.checkStockQuantity("Vanilla Donut")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 8: Call the checkStockQuantity method
DonutInventoryService-> checkStockQuantity method -> donut: Vanilla Donut
CassandraDonutDatabase-> query method -> donut: Vanilla Donut

```

## 提示

- We've kept the **trait type parameters** example simple but it would be good to review variance namely [covariance](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-variance-covariance/) and [contra-variance](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-variance-contra-variance-2/) type parameters.
- In upcoming tutorials in this Chapter, we will also show how to use **traits** to build some pure **Functional Programming** constructs such as [Monoids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid) and [Functors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functor) and much more!
