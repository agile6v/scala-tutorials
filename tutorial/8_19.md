# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Intersect Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **intersect** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **intersect** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **intersect** method will find the common elements between two Sets.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **intersect** method is as follows:

```scala
def intersect(that: GenSet[A]): Repr

```

 

The **intersect **method is a member of the [GenSetLike](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/GenSetLike.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Set of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Set of donut elements where each element in the Set is of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Set of donuts")
val donuts1: Set[String] = Set("Plain Donut", "Strawberry Donut", "Glazed Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts1 = $donuts1")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Set of donuts
Elements of donuts1 = Set(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut)

```

 

### 2. How to initialize another Set of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize another Set of donut elements where each element in the Set is of type String.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to initialize another Set of donuts")
val donuts2: Set[String] = Set("Plain Donut", "Chocolate Donut", "Vanilla Donut")
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to initialize another Set of donuts
Elements of donuts2 = Set(Plain Donut, Chocolate Donut, Vanilla Donut)

```

 

### 3. How to find the common elements between two Sets using intersect function

The code below shows how to the common elements between two Sets by using the intersect function.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to find the common elements between two Sets using intersect function")
println(s"Common elements between donuts1 and donuts2 = ${donuts1 intersect donuts2}")
println(s"Common elements between donuts2 and donuts1 = ${donuts2 intersect donuts1}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to find the common elements between two Sets using intersect function
Common elements between donuts1 and donuts2 = Set(Plain Donut)
Common elements between donuts2 and donuts1 = Set(Plain Donut)

```

 

### 4. How to find the common elements between two Sets using & function

The code below shows how to find the common elements between two Sets by using the & function.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to find the common elements between two Sets using & function")
println(s"Common elements between donuts1 and donuts2 = ${donuts1 & donuts2}")
println(s"Common elements between donuts2 and donuts1 = ${donuts2 & donuts1}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to find the common elements between two Sets using & function
Common elements between donuts1 and donuts2 = Set(Plain Donut)
Common elements between donuts2 and donuts1 = Set(Plain Donut)

```
