# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use Flatten Function


## Overview

In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **flatten** function on collection data structures in Scala. The **flatten** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **flatten** method will collapse the elements of a collection to create a single collection with elements of the same type.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **flatten** method is as follows:

```scala
def flatten[B]: Traversable[B]

```

 

The **flatten** method is a member of the [GenericTraversableTemplate](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/generic/GenericTraversableTemplate.html) trait but there are specialized versions of the flatten methods for given collection types.

## Steps

### 1. How to initialize a Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize a Sequence of Donut elements of type String.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts")
val donuts1: Seq[String] = Seq("Plain", "Strawberry", "Glazed")
println(s"Elements of donuts1 = $donuts1")

```

 

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 1: How to initialize a Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts1 = List(Plain, Strawberry, Glazed)

```

 

### 2. How to initialize another Sequence of donuts

The code below shows how to initialize another Sequence of Donut elements of type String .

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to initialize another Sequence of donuts")
val donuts2: Seq[String] = Seq("Vanilla", "Glazed")
println(s"Elements of donuts2 = $donuts2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to initialize another Sequence of donuts
Elements of donuts2 = List(Vanilla, Glazed)

```

 

### 3. How to create a List of donuts initialized using the two Sequences from Step 1 and Step 2

The code below shows how to create a List of donut elements and initialize the List by using the two donut sequences from Step 1 and Step 2 respectively.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to create a List of donuts initialized using the two Sequences from Step 1 and Step 2")
val listDonuts: List[Seq[String]] = List(donuts1, donuts2)
println(s"Elements of listDonuts = $listDonuts")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to create a List of donuts initialized using the two Sequences from Step 1 and Step 2
Elements of listDonuts = List(List(Plain, Strawberry, Glazed), List(Vanilla, Glazed))


```

**NOTE:**

- We end up with a List containing two inner lists: **List(List(Plain, Strawberry, Glazed), List(Vanilla, Glazed))**
- What if you need to produce a **single** List of donut elements as opposed to having a List with two inner lists? We can achieve this using the **flatten** method as shown in Step 4 below.

### 4. How to return a single list of donut using the flatten function

The code below shows how to use the **flatten** method on the List of donuts which contains two inner donut lists and return a single donut List of type String.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to return a single list of donut using the flatten function")
val listDonutsFromFlatten: List[String] = listDonuts.flatten
println(s"Elements of listDonutsFromFlatten = $listDonutsFromFlatten")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to return a single list of donut using the flatten function
Elements of listDonutsFromFlatten = List(Plain, Strawberry, Glazed, Vanilla, Glazed)

```

**NOTE:**

- By using the flatten method, we were able to collapse the donut String elements into a single list.

### 5. How to append the word Donut to each element of listDonuts using flatten and map functions

The code below shows how to use the **flatten **method followed by the **map** method to produce a **single** **List** of donut elements where the word **Donut** was **appended** to each element.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to append the word Donut to each element of listDonuts using flatten and map functions")
val listDonutsFromFlatten2: List[String] = listDonuts.flatten.map(_ + " Donut")
println(s"Elements of listDonutsFromFlatten2 = $listDonutsFromFlatten2")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 5: How to append the word Donut to each element of listDonuts using flatten and map functions
Elements of listDonutsFromFlatten2 = List(Plain Donut, Strawberry Donut, Glazed Donut, Vanilla Donut, Glazed Donut)

```
