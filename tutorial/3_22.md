# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Create Partial Function Using the PartialFunction Trait


在本节, we will learn how to create **Partial Function** using the **PartialFunction** trait.

 

With pattern matching, if you recall from the [Pattern Matching tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-pattern-matching/), you provide a series of **case** blocks. However, a Partial Function provides **some** but not all the possible case blocks.

 

If none of these make any sense, don't worry :) let's proceed with the examples below.

## 步骤

### 1. Review of Pattern Matching in Scala

First let's review **Pattern Matching** in Scala which you should already be familiar with from the [Pattern Matching tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-how-to-use-pattern-matching/).

 

In the example below, you create a donut of type String with value Glazed Donut and then uses pattern matching to provide the cases for the different taste level.

```scala
println("Step 1: Review of Pattern Matching in Scala")
val donut = "Glazed Donut"
val tasteLevel = donut match {
  case "Glazed Donut" | "Strawberry Donut" => "Very tasty"
  case "Plain Donut" => "Tasty"
  case _ => "Tasty"
}
println(s"Taste level of $donut = $tasteLevel")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 1: Review of Pattern Matching in Scala
Taste level of Glazed Donut = Very tasty

```

 

### 2. How to define a Partial Function named isVeryTasty

Instead of doing a full pattern match for the different taste level of a given donut, let's create a **partial function** named isVeryTasty which will only provide the case for very tasty donuts.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to define a Partial Function named isVeryTasty")
val isVeryTasty: PartialFunction[String, String] = {
  case "Glazed Donut" | "Strawberry Donut" => "Very Tasty"
}

```

**NOTE:**

- Note that we are using the **PartialFunction** trait
- In this example isVeryTasty takes an input of type String which is the donut and produces a String for the taste level. This is specified by **PartialFunction[String, String]**

### 3. How to call the Partial Function named isVeryTasty

Calling the partial function isVeryTasty from step 2 is no different than calling any other function - you simply need to pass its required parameter.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to call the Partial Function named isVeryTasty")
println(s"Calling partial function isVeryTasty = ${isVeryTasty("Glazed Donut")}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 3: How to call the Partial Function named isVeryTasty
Calling partial function isVeryTasty = Very Tasty

```

**NOTE: **

- You will get **scala.MatchError** if the partial function does not have a case which matches the provided input.

### 4. How to define PartialFunction named isTasty and unknownTaste

Now that you know how to define partial functions as shown in Step 2 above, let's define two additional partial functions namely isTasty and unknownTaste.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to define PartialFunction named isTasty and unknownTaste")
val isTasty: PartialFunction[String, String] = {
  case "Plain Donut" => "Tasty"
}

val unknownTaste: PartialFunction[String, String] = {
  case donut @ _ => s"Unknown taste for donut = $donut"
}

```

 

### 5. How to compose PartialFunction using orElse

[Functions in Scala are first class citizens](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/scala-introduction/scala-functional-programming-features/) and as such you can **compose** them. Let's go ahead and use the **orElse()** function which is inherited from the PartialFunction trait and create another PartialFunction named donutTaste.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to compose PartialFunction using orElse")
val donutTaste = isVeryTasty orElse isTasty orElse unknownTaste
println(donutTaste("Glazed Donut"))
println(donutTaste("Plain Donut"))
println(donutTaste("Chocolate Donut"))

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 5: How to compose PartialFunction using orElse
Very Tasty
Tasty
Unknown taste for donut = Chocolate Donut

```
