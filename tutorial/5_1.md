## Chapter 5 – A Beginner’s Tutorial To Using Traits In Scala
in this section, we will go over how to **define and use traits** in the Scala programming language.

 

If you recall from the [Scala Introduction tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/scala-introduction/learn-scala-programming-language/), Scala is both an **Object Oriented** and **Functional** programming language.

 

The examples in this chapter will start off with using **traits** in an **Object** **Oriented** fashion. As we progress throughout the chapter, we will show how to leverage traits in a pure **Functional** context.

 

Throughout the tutorials we will use the popular **IntelliJ IDEA** which we've setup in [Chapter 1](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-1-getting-familiar-intellij-ide/). I hope that by now you are more comfortable using IntelliJ. If not, feel free to review the previous tutorials from [Chapter 1](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-1-getting-familiar-intellij-ide/)!

 

In this chapter, we will provide tutorials on the topics below. If none of these make any sense right now, that's OK :)

- Extend a single trait
- Extend multiple traits
- Using traits for dependency injection
- Dependency injection and the infamous Cake Pattern
- Mixin traits
- Traits as foundation to Functional Programming
