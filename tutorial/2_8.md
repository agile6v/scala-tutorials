# Learn How To Use Range


在本节, we will show how to use the **Scala Range** to help you easily write many items such as numbers or characters in sequence that can be used in looping constructs.

##  Steps

### 1. Create a simple numeric range from 1 to 5 inclusive

This simple example should be familiar to you since we have used it in the previous [For Comprehension tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-for-comprehension/). To create a range of integers starting with 1, incrementally adding 1 up to and including the number 5, you can do the following:

```scala
println("Step 1: Create a simple numeric range from 1 to 5 inclusive")
val from1To5 = 1 to 5
println(s"Range from 1 to 5 inclusive = $from1To5")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 1: Create a simple numeric range from 1 to 5 inclusive
Range from 1 to 5 inclusive = Range(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

```

**NOTE:**

- We are using the `to` keyword which means that the number 5 was included.

### 2. Create a numeric range from 1 to 5 but excluding the last integer number 5

Let's extend the example from Step 1 and create a range of integers starting with 1 and incrementally adding 1 up to the last upper bound of number of 5:

```scala
println("\nStep 2: Create a numeric range from 1 to 5 but excluding the last integer number 5")
val from1Until5 = 1 until 5
println(s"Range from 1 until 5 where 5 is excluded = $from1Until5")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 2: Create a numeric range from 1 to 5 but excluding the last integer number 5
Range from 1 until 5 where 5 is excluded = Range(1, 2, 3, 4)

```

**NOTE:**

- We are using the `until` keyword to exclude the last upper bound which is number 5.

### 3. Create a numeric range from 0 to 10 but increment with multiples of 2

In the examples from Step 1 and 2, we incremented the next number in the range by the default value of 1. But, what if you wanted to increment the range by some arbitrary number other that 1.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: Create a numeric range from 0 to 10 but increment with multiples of 2")
val from0To10By2 = 0 to 10 by 2
println(s"Range from 0 to 10 with multiples of 2 = $from0To10By2")
```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 3: Create a numeric range from 0 to 10 but increment with multiples of 2
Range from 0 to 10 with multiples of 2 = Range(0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

```

**NOTE:**

- We are using the `by` keyword to increment by the number 2 as opposed to the default value of 1.

### 4. Create an alphabetical range to represent letter a to z
So far we have shown how to create numerical ranges. What if you wanted to print the English alphabet starting from the letter a to the letter z.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: Create an alphabetical range to represent letter a to z")
val alphabetRangeFromAToZ = 'a' to 'z'
println(s"Range of alphabets from a to z = $alphabetRangeFromAToZ")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 4: Create an alphabetical range to represent letter a to z
Range of alphabets from a to z = NumericRange(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z)

```

**NOTE:**

- We are using **single quotes** and not double quotes such that we end up with a character range.

### 5. Character ranges with user specified increment

What if you had to print every alternate character in the English alphabet. Similar to Step 3, this can be achieved using the `by` keyword.

```scala
println(s"\nStep 5: Character ranges with user specified increment")
val alphabetRangeFromAToZBy2 = 'a' to 'z' by 2
println(s"Range of every other alphabet = $alphabetRangeFromAToZBy2")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 5: Character ranges with user specified increment
Range of every other alphabet = NumericRange(a, c, e, g, i, k, m, o, q, s, u, w, y)

```

### 6. Convert the Scala Range into collections
If you recall from the previous [For Comprehension tutorial](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-2-learning-basics-scala-programming/scala-tutorial-learn-use-for-comprehension/), we made use of range inside the for loop construct. What if you wanted to store a range in some data structure such as **List**, **Set**, **Sequence** or an **Array**.

```scala
  println("\nStep 6: Storing our ranges into collections")
  val listFrom1To5 = (1 to 5).toList
  println(s"Range to list = ${listFrom1To5.mkString(" ")}")

  val setFrom1To5 = (1 to 5).toSet
  println(s"Range to set = ${setFrom1To5.mkString(" ")}")

  val sequenceFrom1To5 = (1 to 5).toSeq
  println(s"Range to sequence = ${sequenceFrom1To5.mkString(" ")}")

  val arrayFrom1To5 = (1 to 5).toArray
  println(s"Range to array = `${arrayFrom1To5.mkString(" ")}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 6: Storing our ranges into collections
Range to list = 1 2 3 4 5
Range to set = 5 1 2 3 4
Range to sequence = 1 2 3 4 5
Range to array = `1 2 3 4 5

```

**NOTE:**

- We are calling the **.toList, .toSet and .toSeq** functions to convert our ranges into **List**, **Set** and **Sequence** accordingly.
- Note also we skipped the **()** when calling the conversion functions and instead used **.toList** as opposed to .**toList()** This may be confusing at first if you are coming from say **Java** or** .NET**! But I hope it will become more clear when we get to tutorials on functions. The general practice is to skip the () if the function has [no side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)).
- We are also calling the **.mkString()** function to create a string representation of each collection type. The **.mkString()** function takes in a delimiter which in our case is just an empty space.

This concludes our tutorial on** Learn How To Use Range** and I hope you've found it useful!


## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- How to create an inclusive range of integers
- How to create a range of integers which excludes the upper bound
- How to create an integer range with a different increment by parameter
- How to create an alphabet character range from a to z
- How to create an alphabet character range from a to z with a different increment by parameter
- How to convert our ranges into collection data structures such as List, Set and Sequence.

## 提示

- In Step 6, we showed how to **convert** our ranges into collections such as **List**, **Set**, **Sequence** and **Array**. We then used the **mkString()** function to create a string representation for the elements in the collection. However, to access and print each element in the collection, you could just as easily used the **foreach()** function.

```scala
arrayFrom1To5.foreach(print(_))

```

The key thing to remember here is that we used the **wildcard _** as part of the **print()**function parameter.
