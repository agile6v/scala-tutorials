# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Create Polymorphic Function With Generic Return Type



在本节, we will learn how to create **polymorphic** functions which will allow you to specify the **types** of the **parameters** as well as the **return** **type** of the function.

 

This tutorial is a continuation of the previous tutorial on T[yped Functions](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-typed-function/) where you learned how to create functions which have **typed** **parameters**.

## 步骤

### 1. Review how to define a generic typed function which will specify the type of its parameter

Let's first review what we've learned from the previous [tutorial on Typed Functions](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-typed-function/). Typed functions allow you to define functions where you can specify the type of its parameters.

 

In the previous tutorial, we defined an applyDiscount() function which has a generic type parameter named discount.

```scala
println("\nStep 1: Review how to define a generic typed function which will specify the type of its parameter")
def applyDiscount[T](discount: T) {
  discount match {
    case d: String =>
      println(s"Lookup percentage discount in database for $d")

    case d: Double =>
      println(s"$d discount will be applied")

    case _ =>
      println("Unsupported discount type")
  }
}

```

 

### 2. Review how to call a function which has typed parameters

To call the typed function applyDiscount() from Step 1, you have to specify the type of the discount parameter as follows:

```scala
println("\nStep 2: Review how to call a function which has typed parameters")
applyDiscount[String]("COUPON_123")
applyDiscount[Double](10)

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 2: Review how to call a function which has typed parameters
Lookup percentage discount in database for COUPON_123
10.0 discount will be applied

```

**NOTE:**

- Sure you can rely on Scala's type inference to infer the type of your function parameter.
- But in general it's a good practice to explicitly specify your parameter types.

### 3. How to define a polymorphic typed function which also has a generic return type

With the applyDiscount() function from Step 1 in mind, let us define another function which will be **polymorphic** in nature. We will name the function applyDiscountWithReturnType() and it will take a generic type T for its discount parameter. But it will also return a Sequence of the type T.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to define a generic typed function which also has a generic return type")
def applyDiscountWithReturnType[T](discount: T): Seq[T] = {
  discount match {
    case d: String =>
      println(s"Lookup percentage discount in database for $d")
      Seq[T](discount)

  case d: Double =>
      println(s"$d discount will be applied")
      Seq[T](discount)

  case d @ _ =>
      println("Unsupported discount type")
      Seq[T](discount)
  }
}

```

**NOTE:**

- For simplicity, we are returning a new Sequence of type T for each of the cases within the pattern match.

### 4. How to call a generic polymorphic function which also has a generic return type

Let us call the polymorphic applyDiscountWithReturnType() function from Step 3 with different types namely String, Double and Char.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to call a generic typed function which also has a generic return type")
println(s"Result of applyDiscountWithReturnType with String parameter = ${applyDiscountWithReturnType[String]("COUPON_123")}")

println()
println(s"Result of applyDiscountWithReturnType with Double parameter = ${applyDiscountWithReturnType[Double](10.5)}")

println()
println(s"Result of applyDiscountWithReturnType with Char parameter = ${applyDiscountWithReturnType[Char]('U')}")

```

当在 IntelliJ 中运行你的Scala应用程序时，你应该可以看到以下的输出

```scala
Step 4: How to call a generic typed function which also has a generic return type
Lookup percentage discount in database for COUPON_123
Result of applyDiscountWithReturnType with String parameter = List(COUPON_123)

10.5 discount will be applied
Result of applyDiscountWithReturnType with Double parameter = List(10.5)

Unsupported discount type
Result of applyDiscountWithReturnType with Char parameter = List(U)

```

**NOTE:**

- For each of the specified types used when calling the polymorphic function applyDiscountWithReturnType(), the function also returns the Sequence of the same type.

This concludes our tutorial on **Learn How To Create Polymorphic Function With Generic Return Type **and I hope you've found it useful!


## 总结

在这一节，我们介绍了以下内容：

- Reviewed how to define a generic typed function which will specify the type of its parameter
- Reviewed how to call a function which has typed parameters
- How to define a polymorphic typed function which also has a generic return type

## 提示

- Scala's typed functions provide greater flexibility with the use of **variances** which we will see in upcoming tutorials.
- However, if you would like to have a head start, feel free to visit the [official documentation on variances](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/variances.html).
- This tutorial was inspired by the [official Scala documentation on Polymorphic Functions](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/polymorphic-methods.html).
