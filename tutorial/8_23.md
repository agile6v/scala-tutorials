# Scala Tutorial - Learn How To Use MaxBy Function With Examples


In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the **maxBy** function with examples on collection data structures in Scala. The **maxBy** function is applicable to both Scala's [Mutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-7-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-mutable-collection/) and [Immutable](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/) collection data structures.

 

The **maxBy** method takes a predicate function as its parameter and applies it to every element in the collection to return the largest element.

 

As per the Scala documentation, the definition of the **maxBy** method is as follows:

```scala
def maxBy[B](f: (A) â‡’ B): A

```

 

The **maxBy** method is a member of the [TraversableOnce](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/TraversableOnce.html) trait.

## Steps

### 1. How to create a case class to represent Donut object

The code below shows how to create a [case class](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-classes-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-define-use-case-class/) which we will use to represent a Donut object.

```scala
println("Step 1: How to create a case class to represent Donut object")
case class Donut(name: String, price: Double)

```

 

### 2. How to create a Sequence of type Donut

The code below shows how to create a [Sequence](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-6-beginner-tutorial-using-scala-immutable-collection/scala-tutorial-learn-use-immutable-sequence/) of Donut objects by using the Donut **case class** which we created in Step 1.

```scala
println("\nStep 2: How to create a Sequence of type Donut")
val donuts: Seq[Donut] = Seq(Donut("Plain Donut", 1.5), Donut("Strawberry Donut", 2.0), Donut("Glazed Donut", 2.5))
println(s"Elements of donuts = $donuts")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 2: How to create a Sequence of type Donut
Elements of donuts = List(Donut(Plain Donut,1.5), Donut(Strawberry Donut,2.0), Donut(Glazed Donut,2.5))

```

 

### 3. How to find the maximum element in a sequence of case classes objects using the maxBy function

The code below shows how to use the **maxBy** function to find the most expensive Donut from the Donut Sequence defined in Step 2.

```scala
println("\nStep 3: How to find the maximum element in a sequence of case classes objects using the maxBy function")
println(s"Maximum element in sequence of case class of type Donut, ordered by price = ${donuts.maxBy(donut => donut.price)}")


```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 3: How to find the maximum element in a sequence of case classes objects using the maxBy function
Maximum element in sequence of case class of type Donut, ordered by price = Donut(Glazed Donut,2.5)

```

 

### 4. How to declare a value predicate function for maxBy function

The code below shows how to define a [value function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/) which we will pass to the **maxBy**function.

```scala
println("\nStep 4: How to declare a value predicate function for maxBy function")
val donutsMaxBy: (Donut) => Double = (donut) => donut.price
println(s"Value function donutMaxBy = $donutsMaxBy")
```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 4: How to declare a value predicate function for maxBy function
Value function donutMaxBy = <function1>

```

**NOTE:**

- The [value function](http://allaboutscala.com/tutorials/chapter-3-beginner-tutorial-using-functions-scala/scala-tutorial-learn-create-val-function-val-vs-def/) takes a Donut type as input parameter and returns a Double which in this example is the Double value as specified by the Donut's price property.

### 5. How to find the maximum element using maxBy function and pass through the predicate function from Step 4

The code below shows how find the most expensive Donut by using the **maxBy** function but also passing through the **value function** from Step 4.

```scala
println("\nStep 5: How to find the maximum element using maxBy function and pass through the predicate function from Step 4")
println(s"Maximum element in sequence using function from Step 3 = ${donuts.maxBy(donutsMaxBy)}")

```

You should see the following output when you run your Scala application in IntelliJ:

```scala
Step 5: How to frind the maximum element using maxBy function and passing through the predicate function from Step 4
Maximum element in sequence using function from Step 3 = Donut(Glazed Donut,2.5)

```
